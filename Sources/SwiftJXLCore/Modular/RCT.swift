// RCT — reversible colour transform for the Modular sub-codec.
//
// ISO/IEC 18181-1 §C.7.7. The Modular path can decorrelate colour
// channels by applying a small bijective integer transform before
// prediction. For typical photographic / medical-imaging RGB the R,
// G, and B channels are highly correlated (a brightness change tends
// to shift all three by similar amounts); after RCT the dominant
// channel carries the brightness signal and the remaining channels
// carry small differences that prediction-then-entropy can compress
// to close to nothing.
//
// **What this file implements:**
//
// `RCTVariant.ycocgR`: the lossless YCoCg-R transform —
//
//     forward:                          inverse:
//       Co  = R - B                       tmp = Y - (Cg >> 1)
//       tmp = B + (Co >> 1)               G   = Cg + tmp
//       Cg  = G - tmp                     B   = tmp - (Co >> 1)
//       Y   = tmp + (Cg >> 1)             R   = B + Co
//
// This is the standard YCoCg-R reversible variant — exact integer
// round-trip with one bit of bit-depth growth on the chroma channels
// (Co and Cg can be negative). We carry pixel data as `Int32`
// throughout so the growth is absorbed without overflow.
//
// **Caveat:** the JPEG XL spec defines several RCT variants (§C.7.7
// `rct_type` 0..6). YCoCg-R is one of them but the spec's variant
// numbering / selection encoding requires spec text I don't yet
// have. This file ships YCoCg-R as a project-internal primitive
// that's mathematically lossless and round-trip-tested; the
// numbering and encoding need spec verification before it can
// participate in a JXL-spec-compliant codestream.
//
// **Composes with:** the existing prediction pipeline. The intended
// use is: pixels → RCT.forward → per-channel predictor selection →
// residuals → entropy. Inverse applied after pixel reconstruction.
